           UPTO
--------------------------
* jslint again.
* error handling: what to do on throw new Error
* load averaging + options/sliders.
* edge block sidebottomblock

* sometimes: fatal IO error 11 Resource temporarily unavailable.
* speed up (seems to lag the computer, perhaps because of Mainloop)


BRANCH GNOME 3.2  [from default]
- no RECALC mode
- ui.extensionSystem
- toon.actor (??)
- no 'debug' toggle.
- remove windowListener?
BRANCH GNOME 3.4  [from 3.2]
- RECALC mode
- misc.extensionutils
- toon == actor (??)
- no 'debug' toggle.
- remove windowListener?
Toon.Toon = new Lang.Class({
    Name: 'Toon',
    Extends: Clutter.Clone,
    _init: ....
});
BRANCH default
- polyglot (try/catch for diff versions)

BOOKMARK themes [from default]
- sliders for each theme (nPenguins)
- smoother on-the-fly changing
- no need to re-read from disk every time.
BOOKMARK windowed-mode [from default]
- try implement windowed mode.
- XPenguinsWindow.width & height is wider than the window.
- listen to signals from XPenguinsWindow
- onAllWorkspaces only applies for on the desktop toons.
BOOKMARK 'efficiency' toggle
- in God Mode, don't change cursor on mouseover: use Clutter.set_motion_events_enabled(false) for optimisations
- use RECALC.PAUSE or RECALC.END
- if in a window, listen to window button-pressed, not per-actor button-pressed.
- enable load averaging

--------------------------
FUTURE
--------------------------
* error handling from extension level to stop the timeline on error (only way I can think of is a try/catch in this._frame?)
 --> on error, 'off' toggle should call this.exit(), not this._onInterrupt().
* translations from xpenguins, '' -> _("")
* toggle n toons per theme: don't need a checkbox, just a theme & a slider.
* swap in themes on the fly
* They appear in the overview. should they?
* when you smite a toon or it dies, show a little speech bubble '- owwie!' for a second after.

--------------------------
DONE 
--------------------------
* [yep [thread_add_repaint_func]] Clutter.threads_add_repaint_func vs Clutter.Timeline?
* [yep] god mode
* OPTIONS:::
* - [yep] RECALC mode [not in GNOME 3.2]
* - [yep] ignoreMaximised: improve to ignore underneath
* - [yep] onAllWorkspaces
* - [yep] blood
* - [yep] angels
* - [yep] ignore popups
* - [yep] god mode
* - [yep] nPenguins
* - [yep] multiple themes
* [yep, solid] test w/ gnome-panel
* [yep, solid] test w/ autohiding stuff
* [yep] wid/window data/toons cling on to windows.
* [yep] test w/ nautilus desktop window
* [yep] _onInterrupt
* [yep] jumping penguins
* [yep] exploded penguins do not turn into angels until you remove what exploded them ('toon changing from explosion to explosion')
* all the TODOs, remove log/replace with XPUtil, tidy, standardise function names
  - [DONE] toon.js

KNOWN ISSUES, WON'T/CAN'T FIX
-----------------------------
* [WONT] our workspace being destroyed: then they move to the previous workspace (I think)
* [WONT] treat the top activities bar as solid?
* [WONT/CANT][THESE ARE NOT SOLID --> direct clutter.actor, we only deal with window actors] test w/ frippery bottom panel/dock/etc
* [CANT] dual-mon - how to avoid toons going into bad area of stage?
