           UPTO
--------------------------
* test theme.ngenera with 1) loading all at once 2) appending.
* remove_theme.
* rewrite on-the-fly theme changing to use append_theme and remove_theme?
* all the TODOs, remove log/replace with XPUtil, tidy, ...
  - toon.js
  - extension.js
  - theme.js
  - [DONE] util.js
  - [DONE] theme_manager.js
  - windowListener.js
  - xpenguins.js
  - region.js
* error handling: what to do on throw new Error
* load averaging + options/sliders.
* sometimes: fatal IO error 11 Resource temporarily unavailable.
* speed up (seems to lag the computer, perhaps because of Mainloop)
* Performance: addChrome vs add_actor ? only addChrome in god mode?
* Performance/stability: just 'return true;' at the end of _frame to avoid having to keep re-adding

SPLIT into branches:
GNOME 3.2 
- no RECALC mode
- ui.extensionSystem
- toon.actor (??)
- no 'debug' toggle.
- remove windowListener?
GNOME 3.4 
- RECALC mode
- misc.extensionutils
- toon == actor (??)
- no 'debug' toggle.
- remove windowListener?
DEV
- polyglot (try/catch for diff versions)

windowed
- try implement windowed mode.

--------------------------
CODE TIDYING
--------------------------
- XPenguinLoop properties: this.var vs this._var ?
- redundant properties: Theme.names, .ngenera (bind to theme.genus.length?)
- TODOs
- BIGTODOs
- FIXMEs
- comments
           
--------------------------
SEPARATE BRANCH
--------------------------
* windowed mode (onDesktop) --> need to think of an interface. Show overview & pick one? {start a new branch, this is tricky}

--------------------------
FUTURE
--------------------------
* translations from xpenguins, '' -> _('')
* toggle n toons per theme: don't need a checkbox, just a theme & a slider.
* "Efficient" toggle:
  - in God Mode, don't change cursor on mouseover: use Clutter.set_motion_events_enabled(false) for optimisations
  - use RECALC.PAUSE or RECALC.END
  - if in a window, listen to window button-pressed, not per-actor button-pressed.
  - enable load averaging
* swap in themes on the fly
* They appear in the overview. should they?
* when you smite a toon or it dies, show a little speech bubble '- owwie!' for a second after.

--------------------------
DONE 
--------------------------
* [yep] god mode
* OPTIONS:::
* - [yep] RECALC mode [not in GNOME 3.2]
* - [yep] ignoreMaximised: improve to ignore underneath
* - [yep] onAllWorkspaces
* - [yep] blood
* - [yep] angels
* - [yep] ignore popups
* - [yep] god mode
* - [yep] nPenguins
* - [yep] multiple themes
* [yep, solid] test w/ gnome-panel
* [yep, solid] test w/ autohiding stuff
* [yep] wid/window data/toons cling on to windows.
* [yep] test w/ nautilus desktop window
* [yep] _onInterrupt
* [yep] jumping penguins
* [yep] exploded penguins do not turn into angels until you remove what exploded them ('toon changing from explosion to explosion')

-----------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES, WON'T/CAN'T FIX
-----------------------------
* [WONT] treat the top activities bar as solid?
* [WONT/CANT][THESE ARE NOT SOLID --> direct clutter.actor, we only deal with window actors] test w/ frippery bottom panel/dock/etc
* [CANT] dual-mon - how to avoid toons going into bad area of stage?
