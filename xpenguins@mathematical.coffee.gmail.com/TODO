           UPTO
--------------------------
* remove_theme.
* slider to speed up toons
* rewrite on-the-fly theme changing to use append_theme and remove_theme?
* jslint again.
* error handling: what to do on throw new Error
* load averaging + options/sliders.
* edge block sidebottomblock

* sometimes: fatal IO error 11 Resource temporarily unavailable.
* speed up (seems to lag the computer, perhaps because of Mainloop)

SPLIT into branches:
- take away _tempFrameNumber
- remove further comments.
GNOME 3.2 
- no RECALC mode
- ui.extensionSystem
- toon.actor (??)
- no 'debug' toggle.
- remove windowListener?
GNOME 3.4 
- RECALC mode
- misc.extensionutils
- toon == actor (??)
- no 'debug' toggle.
- remove windowListener?
Toon.Toon = new Lang.Class({
    Name: 'Toon',
    Extends: Clutter.Clone,
    _init: ....
});
DEV
- polyglot (try/catch for diff versions)

windowed
- try implement windowed mode.
// Also, if in window: Main.layoutManager._chrome._trackActor(..). not approved.
XPenguinsWindow.width & height is wider than the window.
listen to signals from XPenguinsWindow
onAllWorkspaces only applies for on the desktop toons.

--------------------------
SEPARATE BRANCH
--------------------------
* windowed mode (onDesktop) --> need to think of an interface. Show overview & pick one? {start a new branch, this is tricky}

--------------------------
FUTURE
--------------------------

* translations from xpenguins, '' -> _("")
* toggle n toons per theme: don't need a checkbox, just a theme & a slider.

* "Efficient" toggle:
  - in God Mode, don't change cursor on mouseover: use Clutter.set_motion_events_enabled(false) for optimisations
  - use RECALC.PAUSE or RECALC.END
  - if in a window, listen to window button-pressed, not per-actor button-pressed.
  - enable load averaging
  - * reduce priority of the timeout (GLib.PRIORITY_DEFAULT).
* swap in themes on the fly
* They appear in the overview. should they?
* when you smite a toon or it dies, show a little speech bubble '- owwie!' for a second after.

--------------------------
DONE 
--------------------------
* [yep [thread_add_repaint_func]] Clutter.threads_add_repaint_func vs Clutter.Timeline?

* - [yep] onAllWorkspaces
* - [yep] blood
* - [yep] angels
* - [yep] ignore popups
* - [yep] god mode
* - [yep] nPenguins
* - [yep] multiple themes
* [yep, solid] test w/ gnome-panel

* [yep] wid/window data/toons cling on to windows.
* [yep] test w/ nautilus desktop window
* [yep] _onInterrupt
* [yep] jumping penguins
* [yep] exploded penguins do not turn into angels until you remove what exploded them ('toon changing from explosion to explosion')
* all the TODOs, remove log/replace with XPUtil, tidy, standardise function names

-----------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES, WON'T/CAN'T FIX
-----------------------------
* [WONT] our workspace being destroyed: then they move to the previous workspace (I think)
* [WONT] treat the top activities bar as solid?
* [WONT/CANT][THESE ARE NOT SOLID --> direct clutter.actor, we only deal with window actors] test w/ frippery bottom panel/dock/etc
* [CANT] dual-mon - how to avoid toons going into bad area of stage?
