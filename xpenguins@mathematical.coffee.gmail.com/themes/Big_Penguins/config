# This is the xpenguins config file that defines the theme "Big Penguins".
# It is the same as "Penguins" but scaled up by a factor of 1.5 using 
# the gimp script "resize-frames.scm".

delay 60 # Recommended delay between frames, in milliseconds

# First we set some default values. Note that we cannot set a default
# pixmap. Values not set will take on the system defaults, which are
# usually quite sensible except for width and height, which cannot
# really be guessed.
define default
	width 45  # Default width of each frame
	height 45 # Default height of each frame
	frames 8  # Default number of frames in each pixmap
	speed 6   # Default speed
	directions 1 # Default number of directions 

# We have two types of penguin, "normal" and "skateboarder".  The
# "number" property gives the recommended number of each type to
# start. If any more are initialised then they will be in roughly the
# same proportions. If a pixmap filename starts with "/" then it is
# taken to be an absolute path, otherwise it is taken to be a file in
# the same directory as the config file.

# First define the "normal" penguin:
toon normal
	number 5
	# Walkers and fallers are required by all toons. Fallers drop
	# in from the top of the screen at the start. Floaters also
	# turn into fallers when they hit their head on something.
	define faller	pixmap faller.xpm speed 5
	# Walkers trot along the tops of your windows and along the
	# bottom of your screen. Also possible is a "runner".
	define walker	pixmap walker.xpm directions 2
	# When a toon falls off the end of a window, it turns into a tumbler.
	define tumbler	pixmap tumbler.xpm speed 1 acceleration 1 terminal_velocity 12
	# When a walker walks into something it can turn round, float off, or climb
	define climber	pixmap climber.xpm directions 2
	define floater	pixmap floater.xpm speed 5
	# A toon can die by being "squashed" (getting caught under a window) "splatted"
	# (sometimes a tumbler will land with a bang), "zapped" (at some time in the
	# future I plan to add an option for zapping toons with the mouse) or the
	# "exit" sequence being called by hitting Ctrl-C. If any of these activities
	# not defined by a theme, then the generic "explosion" will be called instead
	# (for example, there is no "squashed" in this theme). Preferably the 
	# explosion should not be too gory - when the "--no-blood" option is used 
	# then "explosion" is used for all death sequences.  
	define explosion	pixmap explosion.xpm width 96 height 96 frames 1
	define exit	pixmap bomber.xpm width 48 height 48 frames 16 directions 1
	define zapped	pixmap zapped.xpm frames 10 directions 2 height 48 width 49
	define splatted	pixmap splat.xpm frames 12 width 48 height 48
	# Dead toons ascend to heaven before being reborn as fallers...
	define angel	pixmap angel.xpm frames 4 width 69 speed 5

	# Up to 6 "actions" may be defined (action0 to action5). However, an action
	# will only be used if all the actions with a lower numerical value also
	# exist. The "loop" property specifies how many times the action should
	# be performed. A negative value (-x) means that the probability of
	# stopping the action every time the loop is performed is 1/x.
	define action0	pixmap reader.xpm frames 12 speed 0 loop -4

# Now define the skateboarder penguin. Note that the program is smart
# enough not to load the same pixmap file twice, so it is perfectly
# efficient to have many toons use the same pixmap in different ways.
