v2.1.1:
* BUGFIX: if you start XPenguins on the desktop and onAllWorkspaces == false,
stop it and then start it again on a *different* workspace, the toons will
ignore the windows.
v2.1:
* when you open the about dialog for a theme, another XPenguins process will
run in that dialog to give you a preview of that theme.
v2.0:
* many changes allowing XPenguins to run in a window
* probably more, but I didn't document them :(
v1.1:
* use windowListener class from the window-HUD repository
* removed ignoreHalfMaximised. It doesn't make sense.
For example, what if a window is under one half-maximised window but over
another? We'd have to restrict to just the visible region, but that involves
a lot of fancy footwork with the Region (i.e. the ability to remove part of
the region that is not one of the constituent rectangles).
  
  I don't want to undertake this footwork!
* efficiency: the XPenguins window bounds (get_box()) is now only calculated
once per loop for all toons (instead of once per toon per function call per
loop). This means storing it in this._toonGlobals.box and refreshing that
every frame.
* removed Toon.setAssociation and replaced with a simple 'this.association ='.
* At the moment we don't properly pause when the XPenguins window becomes
obscured, but we just hide the toons until they can spawn without dying
instantly (in the background they are still respawning every frame though).
What we'd prefer is to know when the XPenguin window has become totally
obscured, and then pause until some part of it is exposed again.
