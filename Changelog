v1.1:
* use windowListener class from the window-HUD repository
* removed ignoreHalfMaximised. It doesn't make sense.
  For example, what if a window is under one half-maximised window but over
  another? We'd have to restrict to just the visible region, but that involves
  a lot of fancy footwork with the Region (i.e. the ability to remove part of
  the region that is not one of the constituent rectangles).
  
  I don't want to undertake this footwork!
